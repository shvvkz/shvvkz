### Notable Projects:

- **Beeanna** üêù
  A Discord bot built with **Rust**, using **Poise** for command handling and **Shuttle** for deployment. The bot integrates with **MongoDB** to manage data and provide efficient community features. This project showcases my ability to combine advanced backend technologies with practical applications for community engagement.

- **Excel Project Tracker** üìä
  A desktop application developed to simplify work hour tracking in my workplace. It processes hundreds of `.xlsx` files to extract employee work hours, providing a streamlined solution for data parsing and analysis. This project allowed me to create an impactful tool tailored to specific organizational needs.

- **Pulse (API done) (In Progress)** üí™
  A REST API built with **Rust**, **Shuttle**, and **Rocket**, designed to serve as the backend for a future mobile application.
